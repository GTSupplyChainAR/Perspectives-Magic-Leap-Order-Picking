<!--
Certain features require a privilege to be requested in the manifest. For the scenes that use these features,
a custom manifest is needed with the required privileges. This file lists all the ones that the examples use.
It can be modified by adding/trimming privileges as needed for the specific example or scene.
The custom manifest should live in the Assets/Plugins/Lumin project folder with the filename manifest.xml.
-->

<!--
Along with being in the manifest, certain privileges need to be requested at runtime as well:

PwFoundObjRead is a sensitive privilege and must be requested before the API that needs it is started.

CameraCapture and AudioCaptureMic are reality privileges and must be requested before the API that needs it
is started and every time the app regains focus, such as returning from a pause.

The examples that use these privileges demonstrate how this is done.
-->

<!--
Unity will automatically fill in areas marked as Placeholder from the Player Settings.
